Sensor made for someone as a drop-in replacement for their ITG pad. Made to be able to be screwed into a wooden pad.
Print all 3 parts, line a piece of 10mm copper tape or thinner along the bottom of the top and bottom. Thread a wire through the hole in the bottom, split it and run one through the hole in the top to the other side, where it should be secured with solder. The other wire should be soldered close to where it enters the bottom half. Secure with hot glue to seal. Final step, insert the "spike" piece into the end of the bottom to keep the top from sliding out (after inserting a carefully cut piece of velostat between the two). 

They're extremely sensitive, and very consistent. 

TODO: Redesign to have wires exit on a more conventional side, like seen in traditional arcade sensors. Clip needs to be redone, as currently they're a bit fragile and need to be fused in place with a soldering iron or similar to be secure at the moment.
