# Velostat-Dance-Game-Sensors
A multitude of models and design files for various designs of 3D printable velostat sensors for dance games. They can be printed in normal old PLA, and only need wire, copper tape, and a strip of velostat/Linqstat. In general, all sensors will be comprised of 2 strips of copper tape on top of one another, separated by a strip of velostat, cut wide enough to prevent the copper tape from ever shorting on each other.

If building a new pad, I'd currently recommend the Azlestomp design.
