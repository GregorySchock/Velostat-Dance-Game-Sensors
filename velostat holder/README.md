# DO NOT USE BASE OR TOP UNLESS YOU WANT AWFUL SENSORS
# Older sensors I've made
The sensors here are some of my earlier attempts at making vstat sensors. 
"Base" and "Top" are provided for historical reasons. They're the first ones I ever tried to make, and are borderline unusable. They require supports to print correctly (unless you'd want to print them vertically, but I always feared they'd crack under pressure). Due to the support removal process, they end up with a gap on one side most of the time, and are almost useless. Don't use them, lol.
"updated bottom" and "updated top" were workhorses of sensors for me for a long time. I've still got one in a pad somewhere I think. They're small, compact, and very effective. Main downside is that they have nothing to retain their sensors, so they can have their tops slide out very easily.
The v2 iterations attempted to address the top sliding out issue, they replace only the bottom half of the previous iteration, the top remains the same. The wiring was a bit difficult on these, and the clip doesn't retain the top as well as I'd hoped, unless it's glued or fused in place. Otherwise, very clean sensors.
